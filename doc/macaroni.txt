*macaroni.txt*  Edit macros with <Leader>q{register letter}

" Author: Brandon Simmons
" Version: 1.0.0

Default Mapping: ~
    <Leader>q

    This mapping will prompt you to type the letter of the register that
    contains your macro ([a-zA-Z]), and, after receiving it, will open the
    command-line-window and construct an ex command that you can modify in
    order to edit the contents of that register.

    For example, assuming that your |<Leader>| key is " " and that you just
    recorded "02f,lgUl" into the "a" register, then typing " qa" will give you
    the following command to edit: >
        :let @a="02f,lgUl"
<
    Press <Enter> after editing to execute the command to overwrite the macro.

    Note: There is no need to wait to see the prompt for the register letter.
          Think of the mapping like this: <Leader>q{register letter of macro}

Escaping and Special Characters: ~
    Any double quote within your macro must be escaped by a backslash: >
        :let @a="0f\"lgUe"
<
    To insert a special character into the macro, such as <Esc> or <Enter>,
    enter Insert mode, type CTRL-V, and then type the special character.

Custom Mapping: ~
    To replace the default mapping with, say, "<Leader>0", add this to your
    config: >
    nmap <unique> <Leader>0 <Plug>MacaroniGetRegisterLetterThenOpenForEditing;
<
